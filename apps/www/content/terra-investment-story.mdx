As someone who made millions working at Google, you'd think I'd be smart with my money. Well, let me tell you about the time I decided to invest my life savings into Terra Luna... after it had already crashed.

## The Decision

It was a dark and stormy night (literally), and I was scrolling through crypto Twitter when I saw Terra Luna had dropped 99.9%. Most people would see this as a red flag. I saw it as a discount.

## The Logic

My reasoning was simple:
1. It can't go down much further (it could)
2. What goes down must come up (not always)
3. I'm an ex-Google engineer, so I must be smart (questionable)

## The Outcome

Well, let's just say I learned that being good at coding doesn't necessarily translate to being good at investing. Sometimes the best lessons are the most expensive ones.

## Lessons Learned

- Past performance doesn't guarantee future results
- "Buying the dip" requires careful analysis
- Diversification is key
- Maybe stick to index funds
