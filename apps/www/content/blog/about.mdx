Hi, I'm Winston.

This is a short history about my life. In chronological order.

I grew up in sunny Singapore. Spent a decade sailing. Managed to qualify for the Youth World's in 2017 where I finished 23rd.

Then I went to do my National Service where I learnt to code from my good friend Wen Yuen. Writing this article by hand reminds me of when I used to write code by hand. Wen Yuen was a good human compiler. I eventually got injured and spend much of the days building a go kart during my breaks in shifts.

Eventually, I finished and headed off to the University of Waterloo to learn more Computer Science.

There I got an internship at Paper in September of 2021 after my third semester.

I ended up loving the team so much I stayed there with the team for the next 5 years. We eventually got acquired by ThirdWeb in July 2023 where I stayed until January 2025. During that time, I got deep into building web applications and managing the infrastructure around it.

Oh, I also managed to graduate in May 2024 while this was going on.

After leaving, I took exactly 1 week where I celebrated Chinese New Year with my family for the first time in 5 years. 

Then, I joined Edward and James (from Paper!) again at their new company Playmatic. Here, we beat OpenAI to achieve state of the art on computer browsing.

Somewhere along the way, I finally decided to build my own baby. I left Playmatic in August of 25. 

Now, I am exploring where technology can bring us next. 

Things I'm tinkering with:

1. Generative AI
1. AI Agents
1. Semantic search
1. Cryptography and end to end encryption
1. Local-first applications

If any of this sounds interesting, feel free to reach out and [contact me](mailto:winstonyeo99@yahoo.com)!
